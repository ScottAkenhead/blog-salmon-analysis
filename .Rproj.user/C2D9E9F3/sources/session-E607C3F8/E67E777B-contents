A bit of background.

This is me: [ORCID:0000-0003-1218-3118](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1218-3118). The last decade was a return to my roots as a marine fisheries ecologist, working with scientists at the Pacific Biological Station. This blog revisits and updates some of those analyses, to provide examples that might be helpful to *ecological detectives* trying to solve salmon mysteries (while learning statistics in R).

Salmon are declining almost everywhere, exceptions mainly northern populations in Alaska and Labrador. After \>30 years of these declines, we know this is because marine survival (the survival of smolts leaving freshwater until returning from the sea as adults) has declined from \~10% to \~1%, but we do not know why. Marine survival is failing in pristine watersheds as well as industrialized watersheds.

What are humans doing wrong to have such a massive and widespread effect? It is not over-fishing. Maybe pollution, or global warming, or hatcheries?

Recently I have involved myself with [IYS](yearofthesalmon.org) and [LSF](https://missingsalmonalliance.org/likely-suspects-framework-home) and most recently a project related to both, **Salmon Data Mobilizat**ion (paper in prep) as means to new, broader, and deeper salmon analyses.

Maybe we should be throwing this problem, this mystery, out to a wider community of ecologists, analysts, and coders. How, though? Seems unlikely that mere blogging will help, but let's see.

Well, that's the typical and safe investment, but salmon populations must speculate in opportunities for new populations (explore), because freshwater habitats are ephemeral.](Sockeye_female_Eiko_Jones_WSP_2018.png){fig-alt="Eiko Jones in WSP 2018"}](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
