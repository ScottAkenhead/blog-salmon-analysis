This is me: [ORCID:0000-0003-1218-3118](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1218-3118). Various adventures and tricks from analyzing [salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon) datasets seem worth sharing. The goal is to help ecological detectives analyze clues to solve the mystery: **Who is (inadvertenly?) killing the salmon?**
