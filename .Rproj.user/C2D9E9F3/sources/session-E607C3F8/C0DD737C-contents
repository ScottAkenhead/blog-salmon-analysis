This is me: [ORCID:0000-0003-1218-3118](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1218-3118). The last decade was a return to my roots as a marine fisheries ecologist, working with scientists at the Pacific Biological Station. This blog revisits and updates analyses, as examples that might be helpful to *ecological detectives* trying to solve salmon mysteries.

Salmon are declining almost everywhere, northern populations in Alaska and Labrador being exceptions this generalization. After \>30 years of losses and declines we know this is about marine survival declining from \~10% (survival of smolts leaving freshwater) to \~1%, but we do not know why. Marine survival is failing in pristine watersheds as well as industrialized watersheds such as the Columbia River. What, exactly, are humans doing wrong to have such a massive and widespread effect? Pollution? Global warming? Hatcheries?

Recently involved with [IYS](yearofthesalmon.org) and [LSF](https://missingsalmonalliance.org/likely-suspects-framework-home) and with Salmon Data Mobilization (paper in prep) as means to new salmon analyses and models. Maybe we should be throwing this problem out to a wider community of analysts and coders. How, though? Seems unlikely that blogging will help, but let's see.
